# Ramp
Ramp is a peer to peer application that allows users to chat, send files, and video chat with other active users through direct TCP connection.

In order to install Ramp, run the executable file 'setup.sh' that is located in the scripts file. This will install python2.7.13 and necessary modules for Ramp. Return to the ramp main directory and run 'python 2.7 init_db.py' in terminal. You should now be able to run ramp with the command 'python2.7 main.py'.

In order to read the man page, in the ramp directory run the line 'man ./ramp'. This will give you further information on the project.
