what project needs:
- code and makefiles
- man pages for users (man pages), sysamin (how to compile and install, plat
forms that it works on), and developer (describe algorithm, continue it)
- licensing, history or development, credits, possible security issues
- non-trivial test examples (should probably write a script displaying what
the project does)

grading:
- how well program structured so easy further development
- diagram modules and API
- quality of documentation (not length)
- functional, efficient, innovative numerrical algorithm, show tests on 
provided examples

img to ascii(probably 3ish hours of work):
- use opencv to convert picture to grayscale pixel array
- from grayscale set different chars to different values
-

file sharing:
- write in python and if need be extend in C
- gui in tkinter

things to remember:
- document versions with explanation of what has been changed
